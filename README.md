Hello, my name is Esteban (Alias: Shylex) and it is one of my biggest first proyects. 

First of all, I hope everyone could find enjoyable this game and if you have time, I really appreciate feedback in order to improve for other projects.

I would like to highlight that programming a website game was a challenging but incredibly rewarding experience for me. As a self-taught programmer, I was constantly learning and pushing myself to improve my skills. 

The process of building the game from the ground up was both frustrating and exhilarating. There were times when I encountered bugs and errors that seemed impossible to solve, but the sense of accomplishment I felt when I finally figured out the solution was indescribable.
Hours looking for a dumb error, reading stackoverflow trying to find a solution or watching tutorials were my day to day.

One of the most satisfying aspects of programming the game was being able to see the final product come to life.

Overall, programming the website game was an incredible learning experience that taught me a lot about problem-solving, patience, and the importance of persistence. I can't wait to take on my next programming project and see what I'm capable of creating.

Have to add that I love the game and surely I'll add more content to it!

# Specials Thanks

I have to mention that this project has been carried out thanks to two special people.

One of them is Javi (Alias: Adame98), a classmate, who was supporting me and encouraging me to continue, giving me ideas and possible solutions to reject code that I had initially discarded, giving it an outlet elsewhere.

And of course, Pablo, one of my teachers who has supported me to do the project and has provided me with possible solutions when I have been stuck. Without a doubt, a great support.

I want to say a big thank you to these two people and say that without them, perhaps this project would not have come to fruition.
A great reminder that with good companions you can go far.
