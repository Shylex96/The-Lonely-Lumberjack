		<h2>The Lonely Lumberjack</h2>
		<p>As the sun set on day, the lumberjack sat back in his cabin and let out a contented sigh. Over the past few weeks, he had worked tirelessly, cutting down trees and collecting resources in order to build his cabin. Despite the long hours and hard work, the lumberjack couldn't help but feel a sense of accomplishment as he looked around at all that he had built. His cabin was now a cozy and well-furnished home, stocked with all the resources he needed to thrive in the wilderness. But the lumberjack knew that his journey was far from over. There were still new lands to explore and more resources to gather. And with each passing day, he grew stronger and more skilled at the art of wood.<br><br> 

			One day, as he drifted off to sleep, the lumberjack knew that he was ready to take on whatever challenges the world had in store for him. And he was excited to see what the future held for himself. As the lumberjack's needs continued to grow, he found himself in need of more hands to help him manage the increasing workload. And so, he set out in search of a reliable partner to join him on his journey. It wasn't long before he found just the person he was looking for: a skilled and hardworking lumberjack by the name of Sarah.<br><br>
			
			Together, the two of them worked tirelessly, cutting down trees and gathering resources as they expanded their territory. Sarah proved to be an invaluable partner, always willing to lend a helping hand and bring new ideas to the table. With her by his side, the lumberjack knew that he could tackle any challenge that came his way. As the months passed and their work continued to thrive, the lumberjack couldn't help but feel grateful for the chance to work alongside such a talented and dedicated partner. As the years passed, the lumberjack and Sarah became a formidable team, tackling any challenge that came their way and overcoming every obstacle that stood in their path And he knew that together, they would be able to achieve even greater things in the world but, one day, Sarah became seriously ill without expecting it.<br><br>
			
			The days went by until one day Sarah couldn't take the disease anymore and she died. The news of Sarah's sudden illness came as a shock to the lumberjack, he was devastated by the loss of his dear friend and partner. But despite his grief, he knew that he couldn't let everything they built fall to ruin. And so, with a heavy heart, he set out in search of a new partner to help him continue the work they had started together.<br><br>
			
			Unfortunately, he searched and searched but couldn't find anyone at Sarah's level. He was trying with all his might to maintain everything they had built, but he was alone and he wasn't capable of maintaining everything by his own.<br><br>
			
			To this day, he is alone, looking for a new partner to work with and maybe someday, build greater things again.</p>
